# NLP-Basics

Tokenization: Splitting text into individual words or tokens.

Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging: Assigning grammatical categories (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) to each word in a text.

Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying and classifying named entities such as persons, organizations, locations, dates, and more. Dependency Parsing: Analyzing the syntactic structure of sentences to determine the relationships between words.

Sentence Segmentation: Splitting text into individual sentences. Word Embeddings: Generating dense vector representations of words in a high-dimensional space.

Text Classification: Assigning predefined categories or labels to text documents based on their content.

Entity Linking: Linking named entities in text to entries in a knowledge base or database.

Text Similarity: Computing similarity between text documents or individual sentences.

Rule-based Matching: Identifying sequences of tokens based on user-defined patterns or rules.

Custom Pipeline Components: Extending spaCy with custom functions or components to perform specific tasks.

Named Entity Recognition (NER) Training: Training custom NER models on annotated data for domain-specific entities.

Visualization: Visualizing syntactic parse trees, dependency graphs, or entity recognition results.
